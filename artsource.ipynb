       "['Although this list is the result of a deep study of the painters, their contribution to Western painting, and their influence on later artists; we are aware that objectivity does not exist in Art, so we understand that most readers will not agree 100% with this list. In any case, theartwolf.com assures that this list is only intended as a tribute to painting and the painters who have made it an unforgettable Art.',\n",
       " 'Love him or hate him, Pablo Picasso changed it all. He is to Art History a giant earthquake with eternal consequences. Nobody tried harder than Picasso to create the avant-garde. And no one tried harder to destroy it. He looked back at the masters and created a personal style that was imitated by artists around the globe. During his later years, his works are often somewhat dull and unexciting, but his unmatched legacy had already been set. For the better or for the worse.',\n",
       " 'The greatest renovator of early European painting, Giotto was the first to deviate from the rigid course of Byzantine painting. With his unusually imaginative talent, his original iconographies, and his remarkable love for the nature and the human expression, Giotto revolutionized Western Art to the point that many critics consider him, not without reason, the first genius of European painting, praised by his contemporaries Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio.',\n",
       " 'There is no artist more legendary than Leonardo da Vinci. In the entire History of Art, no other name has generated more debates, more discussions and more hours of study than the genius born in Vinci in 1452, who will be always known as the author of the most famous painting of all times, the Gioconda or Mona Lisa.',\n",
       " 'Along with Rembrandt, Vel√°zquez represents the zenith of Baroque painting. But unlike the Dutchman, the Sevillian artist spent most of his life in the comfortable but rigid court society. Despite this, Vel√°zquez was a renovator, a ‚Äúpainter of atmospheres‚Äù almost two centuries before Turner or the Impressionists, and he captured this in his colossal royal paintings (‚ÄúMeninas‚Äú, ‚ÄúThe Forge of Vulcan‚Äú) as well as in the bold and unforgettable sketches of the Villa Medici.',\n",
       " 'Few artists -perhaps none- played as decisive a role as Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) in the development of abstract art, the greatest revolution in Western art since the Renaissance. Over a period of three years, at the dawn of the First World War, Kandinsky culminated a personal artistic evolution that had begun 20 years earlier when, impressed by Monet‚Äôs painting, he began to experiment with the power of pure paint and the capacity of colour to express feelings.',\n",
       " 'The importance of Monet in the history of art is sometimes ‚Äúunderrated‚Äù, as Art lovers tend to see only the overwhelming beauty that emanates from his canvases, ignoring the complex technique and composition of the work (a ‚Äúdefect‚Äù somehow caused by Monet himself, when he declared that ‚ÄúI do not understand why everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love‚Äù). However, Monet‚Äôs experiments, including his studies on the changes in the same object caused by daylight at different times of the day; and the almost abstract quality of his ‚Äúwater lilies‚Äù, are clearly a prologue to the art of the twentieth century.',\n",
       " 'The tough and violent Caravaggio is considered the father of Baroque painting, with his spectacular use of lights and shadows. Caravaggio‚Äôs chiaroscuro became so famous that many painters started to copy his paintings, creating the ‚ÄòCaravaggisti‚Äô style.',\n",
       " 'Van Eyck is the colossal pillar on which all Flemish painting of later centuries rests, a genius of precision, perspective and meticulousness, far above any other artist of his time, Flemish or Italian.',\n",
       " 'Turner is the best landscape painter of Western painting. Albeit an academic painter during his first years, Turner slowly but unstoppably evolved towards a free, atmospheric style, sometimes even outlining the abstraction, which was misunderstood and rejected by the same critics who then admired him for decades.',\n",
       " 'The real Leonardo da Vinci of Northern European Rennaisance was Albrecht D√ºrer, a restless and innovative genious, master of drawing and color. He was one of the first artists to represent nature without artifice, either in his painted landscapes or in his drawings of plants and animals.',\n",
       " 'Some readers will be quite surprised to see a man who is arguably the greatest artistic genius of all time out of the ‚Äútop ten‚Äù of this list, but the fact is that even Michelangelo defined himself as ‚Äúsculptor‚Äù, and even his painted masterpiece (the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel) are often defined as ‚Äòpainted sculptures‚Äô. Nevertheless, that unforgettable masterpiece is enough to guarantee him a place of honor in the history of painting.',\n",
       " 'Goya is an enigma. In the whole History of Art few figures are as complex as the artist born in Fuendetodos, Spain. Enterprising and indefinable, a painter with no rival in all his life, Goya was the painter of the Court and the painter of the people. He was a religious painter and a mystical painter. He was the author of the beauty and eroticism of the ‚ÄòMaja desnuda‚Äô and the creator of the explicit horror of ‚ÄòThe Third of May, 1808‚Äô. He was an oil painter, a fresco painter, a sketcher and an engraver. And he never stopped his metamorphosis.',\n",
       " 'Few names in the history of painting are now as famous as Van Gogh, despite the complete neglect he suffered in life. His works, strong and personal, are one of the greatest influences in the twentieth century painting, especially for the German Expressionism.',\n",
       " 'Manet was the origin of Impressionism, a revolutionary in a time of great artistic revolutions. His (at the time) quite polemical ‚ÄúOlympia‚Äù or ‚ÄúD√©jeuner sur l‚ÄôHerbe‚Äù opened the way for the great figures of the Impressionism.',\n",
       " 'Some art critics tend to regard Matisse as the greatest exponent of twentieth century painting, only surpassed by Picasso. That is quite debatable, although the almost pure use of color in some of his works strongly influenced many of the following avant-gardes.',\n",
       " 'Equally loved and hated in different eras, no one can doubt that Raphael is one of the greatest geniuses of the Renaissance, with an excellent technique in terms of drawing and color.',\n",
       " 'The major figure of American Abstract Expressionism, Pollock created his best works, his famous drips, between 1947 and 1950. After those fascinating years, comparable to Picasso‚Äôs Blue Period or van Gogh‚Äôs final months in Auvers, he abandoned the drip, and his latest paintings are often bold, uninspired works.',\n",
       " 'A pioneer of abstract art, Hilma af Klint was a painter who remained ‚Äì by her own wish ‚Äì outside any organized artistic movement, and she never exhibited her now famous works during her lifetime. Nevertheless, in recent years she has achieved unanimous recognition as one of the most original figures of modernism.',\n",
       " 'One of the most original and fascinating artists of his era, with a very personal technique that was admired, three centuries later, by the impressionist painters. A true innovator in the broadest sense of the word.',\n",
       " 'One of the most fascinating figures in the history of painting, his works moved from Impressionism (soon abandoned) to a colorful and vigorous symbolism, as can be seen in his ‚ÄòPolynesian paintings‚Äô. Matisse and Fauvism could not be understood without the works of Paul Gauguin.',\n",
       " 'Basquiat is undoubtedly the most important and famous member of the ‚Äúgraffiti movement‚Äù that appeared in the New York scene in the early‚Äô80s, an artistic movement whose enormous influence on later painting is still to be measured.',\n",
       " 'Modernist in his context, Munch could be also considered the first expressionist painter in history. Works like ‚ÄúThe Scream‚Äù are vital for the understanding of twentieth century painting.',\n",
       " 'After the premature death of Giorgione, Titian became the leading figure of Venetian painting of his time. His use of color and his taste for mythological themes defined the main features of 16th century Venetian Art. His influence on later artists -Rubens, Vel√°zquez‚Ä¶- is extremely important.',\n",
       " 'Maximum exponent, along with Lucian Freud, of Postwar British Art, Bacon‚Äôs painting rebelled against all the canons of previous painting, not only in terms of beauty, but also against the abstraction of the dominant Abstract Expressionism of the time.',\n",
       " 'Brilliant and controversial, Warhol is the leading figure of pop-art and one of the icons of contemporary art. His silkscreen series depicting icons of the mass-media (as a reinterpretation of Monet‚Äôs series of Water lilies or the Rouen Cathedral) are one of the milestones of contemporary Art, with a huge influence in the Art of our days',\n",
       " 'Rubens was one of the most prolific painters of all time, thanks in part to the collaboration of his study. Very famous in life, he traveled around Europe to meet orders from very wealthy and important clients. His female nudes are still amazing in our days.',\n",
       " 'Vermeer was the leading figure of the Delft School, and for sure one of the greatest genre painters of all time. Works such as ‚ÄúView of the Delft‚Äù are considered almost ‚Äúimpressionist‚Äù due to the liveliness of his brushwork. He was also a skilled portraitist, and his ‚ÄúGirl With a Pearl Earring‚Äù has been called the ‚ÄúMona Lisa of the North‚Äù.',\n",
       " 'Like most geniuses, Miro is an unclassificable artist. His interest in the world of the unconscious, those ideas and emotions hidden in the depths of the mind, link him with Surrealism, but with a personal style, sometimes closer to Fauvism and Expressionism. His most important works are those from the series of ‚ÄúConstellations‚Äú, created in the early 40s.',\n",
       " 'Masaccio was one of the first old masters to use the laws of scientific perspective in his works. One of the greatest and most innovative painters of the Early Renaissance.',\n",
       " 'One of the most gifted artists of the early baroque era, she was the first female painter to become a member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence. During the last decades reevaluation of her work has placed Gentileschi in the place she deserves among the greatest painters of her era.',\n",
       " 'Despite being one of the most important figures of the quattrocento, the art of Piero della Francesca has been described as ‚Äúcold‚Äù, ‚Äúhieratic‚Äù or even ‚Äúimpersonal‚Äù. But with the apparition of Berenson and the great historians of his era, like Michel H√©rubel -who admired the ‚Äúmetaphysical dimension‚Äù of the paintings by Piero-, his precise and detailed Art finally occupied the place that it deserves in the History of Art.',\n",
       " 'Along with Kandinsky and Malevich, Mondrian is the leading figure of early abstract painting. After emigrating to New York, Mondrian filled his abstract paintings with a fascinating emotional quality, as it can be seen in his series of ‚Äúboogie-woogies‚Äù created in the mid-40s.',\n",
       " 'Leading figure of realism, and a key precedent for the impressionists, Courbet was one of the greatest revolutionaries, both as an artist and as a social-activist, of the history of painting. Like Rembrandt and other predecessors, Courbet did not seek to create beauty, but believed that beauty is achieved when the artist represents the purest reality without artifice.',\n",
       " 'The greatest among the great French Baroque painters, Poussin had a vital influence on French painting for many centuries. His use of color is unique among all the painters of his era.',\n",
       " 'Half way between modernism and symbolism appears the figure of Gustav Klimt, who was also devoted to the industrial arts. His nearly abstract landscapes also make him a forerunner of geometric abstraction.',\n",
       " 'Eug√®ne Delacroix is the French romanticism painter ‚Äúpar excellence‚Äù and one of the most important names in the European painting of the first half of the 19th century. His famous ‚ÄúLiberty leading the People‚Äù also demonstrates the capacity of Painting to become the symbol of an era.',\n",
       " '‚ÄúSolitary, eccentric, melancholic and poor‚Äù. Giorgio Vasari described with these four words one of the most audacious geniuses of the early Florentine Renaissance, Paolo Uccello. Without a doubt, one of the key figures of the Quattrocento.',\n",
       " 'Revolutionary and mystic, painter and poet, Blake is one of the most fascinating artists of any era. His watercolors, prints and temperas are filled with a wild imagination (almost crazyness), unique among the artists of his era',\n",
       " 'Leading figure of German Romantic painting, Friedrich was, as David d‚ÄôAngers said, a man who had discovered ‚Äòthe tragedy of landscape‚Äô, a painter of landscapes of loneliness and distress, with human figures facing the terrible magnificence of nature.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, Frida‚Äôs increasing fame seems to have obscured her importance in Latin American art. Marked since childhood by the physical aftermath of a bus accident, Kahlo‚Äôs self-portraits seem like silent, yet powerful wails.',\n",
       " 'Creator of Suprematism (do not mispell this word‚Ä¶), Malevich will forever be one of the most controversial figures of the history of art among the general public, divided between those who consider him an essential innovator and those who consider that his works based on polygons of pure colors do not deserve to be considered Art.',\n",

During his later years, his works are often somewhat dull and unexciting, but his unmatched legacy had already been set. For the better or for the worse.',\n",

This lapidary phrase has been attributed to both Picasso and Matisse, and it certainly matters little who actually said it, because it is true in any case. Riding the wave of fresh air that Impressionism represented, C√©zanne left the entire Impressionist group behind to develop a style of painting hitherto unseen, which opened the door wide for the arrival of Cubism and the rest of the 20th century avant-garde.',\n",
